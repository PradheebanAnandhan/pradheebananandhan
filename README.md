# Hey! I’m Pradheeban 👋

I’m a final-year CSE (AIML) student at Sri Eshwar College of Engineering.  
Over the past few years, I’ve spent a lot of time exploring **machine learning, NLP, and full-stack systems**. I enjoy building things that combine data, intelligence, and simple user interfaces.

I really enjoy working with:
- Machine Learning models
- Deep Learning experimentation
- NLP for text understanding
- The MERN stack for web apps
- A bit of deployment and tooling when needed

Right now, I’m learning React Native because I like the idea of building mobile experiences powered by AI.  
I’m also getting familiar with Azure so I can understand how ML models behave once they leave Jupyter notebooks and go into real environments.

## 🌱 What I’m actively working on or exploring
- Improving my ML/NLP understanding through small projects
- Trying to make useful AI tools with simple UI
- Understanding how to design better systems end-to-end
- Sharpening problem solving through coding platforms

---

## 🔧 Tools and technologies I’m comfortable with
**C, C++, Java, Python, React, Node.js, MongoDB, Flask, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, PyTorch, LangChain**

I don’t claim to be an expert in all of them — but I’ve used them enough to build working systems and understand what goes into making ML projects real.

## 🔍 Problem Solving
I like solving algorithmic problems whenever I want a break from ML.  
Here’s my LeetCode progress if you’re curious:

## 🌐 Feel free to reach out
I’m always open to discussing ML, NLP, full-stack applications, or even random experiments that involve data.  
If you have an idea and want to build something together, I’m happy to explore it.

### ⚡ A small personal note
I genuinely enjoy the learning curve, building something, breaking it, fixing it, and learning something new each time.  
That’s what keeps me excited about tech.
